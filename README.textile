h1. JSActionSheet

@UIActionSheets@ are great, but sometimes you just want a little something more than buttons. JSActionSheet affords you that luxury by allowing you to easily plug in a new UIActionSheet-like view into your iPhone app.

A JSActionSheet with a UIPickerView can be easily added with the following few lines of code:

<pre>
- (IBAction)showPickerActionSheet:(id)sender {
    JSPickerViewActionSheet *pickerAS = [[JSPickerViewActionSheet alloc] init];
    pickerAS.delegate = self;
    
    [pickerAS showInView:self.view];
}
</pre>

Be sure to declare that your UIViewController conforms to the JSActionSheetDelegate protocol, and that you import JSPickerViewActionSheet into your view controller's implementation file.

The beauty is that MVC is maintained by allowing you to handle all delegation/data source methods for the @UIPickerView@ within your @UIViewController@!

This is a work-in-progress and I will be progressively adding more and more variations on the @UIActionSheet@ theme. Contributions are always welcome!
